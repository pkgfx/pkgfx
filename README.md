Hi and Welcome to my Github.

I have ben working as an IT-Specialist within SCCM and Data analysis since 2016.

i've recently started going more into Azure as the company i work for (DSV Transport and logistics) are moving more workloads to the cloud.

My forces are, well offcause SCCM/MEMCM and Data Analysis, but also SQL/Powershell.

My goto applications are usually the SCCM Console, SQL Studio, PowerBI, Excel, SQL Report Designer, Powershell.

i've just recently started to transcend to PowerBI for my reports and analysis.

You can fetch me at Twitter @pkgfx or LinkedIN (Michael Robert SÃ¤ila)
